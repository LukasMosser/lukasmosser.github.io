I'm Lukas Mosser. A PhD student at Imperial College London (ICL) under supervision of Olivier Dubrule and Martin Blunt. I work on computational geoscience problems, specifically merging deep neural networks with Bayesian inversion techniques. My main technical interests are in Bayesian techniques for geophysical inverse problems, numerical solution of PDE's and deep learning. Ideally, a combination of three.

Feel free to follow me on twitter [@porestar](https://twitter.com/porestar), my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.at/citations?user=y0R9snMAAAAJ&hl=de), or [Github](https://github.com/lukasmosser).

"This is so going in my blog!" - Barney Stinson
------
Well, there's nothing here yet but here's the plan:
I'm gonna be finishing my PhD fairly soon, so I need to get in the habit of writing. I usually do alot of writing anyways, but that goes straight to a paper most of the time. Here, I hope to post more ad-hoc things, cool projects or papers I found and reviewed or libraries that I want to share. There's already a 3 part blog in the making that I've been working on for a while so hopefully to be shared soon.

Active Projects
------
I maintain a few active projects at the moment:
- [geodeadlin.es](http://www.geodeadlin.es): A repository of upcoming abstract deadlines for geoscience conferences.
- [ASI-Pytorch](https://www.github.com/lukasmosser/asi-pytorch): Collection of automated seismic interpretation models written in pytorch. PR's welcome!
- [PorousMediaGAN](https://github.com/LukasMosser/PorousMediaGan): Acompanying repository for our paper on porous media reconstruction in [Phys. Rev. E](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.96.043309)
