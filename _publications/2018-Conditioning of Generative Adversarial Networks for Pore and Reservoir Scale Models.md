Geostatistical modelling of petrophysical properties is a key step in modern integrated oil and gas reservoir studies. Recently, generative adversarial networks (GAN) have been shown to be a successful method for generating unconditional simulations of pore- and reservoir-scale models. This contribution leverages the differentiable nature of neural networks to extend GANS to the conditional simulation of three-dimensional pore- and reservoir-scale models. Based on the previous work of Yeh et al. (2016), we use a content loss to constrain to the conditioning data and a perceptual loss obtained from the evaluation of the GAN discriminator network. The technique is tested on the generation of three-dimensional micro-CT images of a Ketton limestone constrained by two-dimensional cross-sections, and on the simulation of the Maules Creek alluvial aquifer constrained by one-dimensional sections. Our results show that GANs represent a powerful method for sampling conditioned pore and reservoir samples for stochastic reservoir evaluation workflows.
