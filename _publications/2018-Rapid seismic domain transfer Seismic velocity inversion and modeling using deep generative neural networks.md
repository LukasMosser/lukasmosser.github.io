Traditional physics-based approaches to infer sub-surface properties such as fullwaveform
inversion or reflectivity inversion are time consuming and computationally
expensive. We present a deep-learning technique that eliminates the need for
these computationally complex methods by posing the problem as one of domain
transfer. Our solution is based on a deep convolutional generative adversarial network
and dramatically reduces computation time. Training based on two different
types of synthetic data produced a neural network that generates realistic velocity
models when applied to a real data set. The system’s ability to generalize means
it is robust against the inherent occurrence of velocity errors and artifacts in both
training and test datasets.
